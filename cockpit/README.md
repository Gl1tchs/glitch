# Glitch-Cockpit - Fully fledged editor for military grade simulations

Glitch Cockpit is an advanced, modular C++ Vulkan-based rendering and simulation editor designed for real-time tactical simulations, recon visualization, and interactive battlefield scenario creation.

It evolves the core Glitch engine into a powerful editor/workbench for building GIS-enabled terrain, destructible environments, physics-driven ballistics, and multi-layered recon views.
