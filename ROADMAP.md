# Vulkan Engine Roadmap

## Fundamentals
- [x] Understand core concepts (Instances, Physical Devices, Logical Devices, Queues, Command Buffers)
- [x] Learn Vulkan's memory model (Buffers, Images, Memory Allocation)
- [x] Familiarize with Vulkan's pipeline architecture (Shader Stages, Vertex Input, Assembly, Rasterization, Fragment Shader, Output Merger)
- [x] Setup and initialize Vulkan instance and choose extensions
- [x] Select physical device and create logical device
- [x] Setup queues and command buffers
- [x] Create a swap chain for rendering
- [x] Create and manage Vulkan surfaces
- [x] Write and compile shaders (GLSL to SPIR-V)
- [x] Setup the graphics pipeline
- [x] Draw a simple triangle

## Intermediate Techniques
- [x] Efficient memory allocation strategies
- [x] Understand and implement synchronization (fences, semaphores)
- [x] Manage and optimize buffers and images
- [x] Implement texture mapping
- [x] Use Uniform Buffers and Descriptor Sets
