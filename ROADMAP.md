# Roadmap

## GIS

- [ ] High resolution real world geospatial data and satelite imagery
- [ ] Procedural terrain generation for unclassified data
- [ ] Real time terrain deformation such as craters and vehicle tracks
- [ ] Military-grade coordinate systems like MGRS
- [ ] Environmental effects like rain, fog, wind and their impacts on visibility, sensors and vehicle performance
- [ ] Day-night cycles, atmospheric scattering, and seasonal variations using real-world meteorological data.
- [ ] Optimize for large-scale environments (e.g., entire regions or continents) using level-of-detail (LOD) techniques, tiling, and streaming to handle massive datasets efficiently

## Physics

- [ ] Rigid body dynamics to simulate mass, inertia and collision
- [ ] Soft body and fluid dynamics for water bodies and chemical dispresion
- [ ] Balistics and weapon systems with drag, wind effects, and material penetration
- [ ] Recoil, muzzle velocity, and blast effects with high fidelity
- [ ] Non-kinetic effects like electronic warfare or laser systems
- [ ] Realistic vehicle dynamics, including suspension, traction, and terrain interaction
- [ ] Implement detailed damage models for vehicles and structures, accounting for material properties and hit locations.
- [ ] UAV and flight mechanics

## Communication Systems

- [ ] Sensors like radar, infrared and electro optical systems with realistic noise, interference, and range limitations
- [ ] Signal degradation, interference, and encryption

## Rendering and graphics

- [ ] PBR Pipeline
- [ ] Volumetric fog, global illumination and particle system
- [ ] Optimization methods such as LOD and Instancing

## Interoperability and Standards

- [ ] MIL-STD-2525 for symbology and NATO STANAG for interoperability
- [ ] C4I format (Command, Control, Communications, Computers, and Intelligence) for integration with military systems

## Security

- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data such as planning and terrain information
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging

## Editor

- [ ] User friendly editor for designing custom scenarios
- [ ] Scripting for complex mission logic and dynamic events
- [ ] Record simulation data for playback and analysis, including unit movements, communications, and decisions
- [ ] Visualization tools (e.g., heatmaps, timelines) for debriefing
